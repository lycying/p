The Raspberry Pi Camera Module is a 5 megapixel custom designed add-on for Raspberry Pi, featuring a fixed focus lens. It's capable of 2592 x 1944 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p60/90 video. It attaches to Pi by way of one of the small sockets on the board upper surface and uses the dedicated CSi interface, designed especially for interfacing to cameras.

*5 megapixel native resolution sensor-capable of 2592 x 1944 pixel static images
*Supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p60/90 video
*Camera is supported in the latest version of Raspbian, Raspberry Pi's preferred operating system

The board itself is tiny, at around 25mm x 20mm x 9mm. It also weighs just over 3g, making it perfect for mobile or other applications where size and weight are important. It connects to Raspberry Pi by way of a short ribbon cable.

The sensor itself has a native resolution of 5 megapixel, and has a fixed focus lens on-board. In terms of still images, the camera is capable of 2592 x 1944 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p60/90 video.

The camera is supported in the latest version of Raspbian, Raspberry Piâ€™s preferred operating system.
